### Scripts

Scripts to automate tedious tasks / do things faster / productivity

commit.sh: Add all change files and commit them with a message
setupgit.sh: Sets up a git repository and optionally pushes it up
nukeonly.sh: Removes all occurences of describe.only and it.only in a javascript test file
doubledollar.py: For a given file, reformats math formatting of the form $ _equation_ $ to $$ _equation_ $$ because Jupyter supports the former but Github-flavored markdown only supports the format
s2nb.py: Converts a python script to a Jupyter Notebook
